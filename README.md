# PathFinder
Visualize popular pathfinding algorithms in action. Set start and end points, create obstacles, and watch as Dijkstra's, A*, DFS, and BFS find the shortest path. Explore the power of algorithms in solving pathfinding problems.

**Features:**

- Set the start and end points on the grid.
- Add walls to simulate real-world environments, creating obstacles, making it harder for the algorithm to find the destination.
- Witness the algorithms in action as they find the shortest path from the start to the end node.
- Compare the efficiency and effectiveness of different algorithms.
- Clear the grid and start fresh with a single click.

**Algorithms:**

- Dijkstra's: A weighted algorithm that guarantees the shortest path but explores all possibilities.
- A*: A heuristic-based algorithm that combines the cost to reach a node with the estimated cost to reach the goal.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores nodes in a breadth-first manner, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores nodes in a depth-first manner, which may not guarantee the shortest path but can be efficient in certain scenarios.

**How to Use:**

1. Set the start and end points on the grid if you want to change the default start and end points.
2. Customize the grid by adding walls.
3. Select an algorithm to visualize its pathfinding process.
4. Observe the animation and track the visited nodes.
5. Compare the paths and performance of different algorithms.
6. Reset the grid to start fresh or modify it for new experiments.
